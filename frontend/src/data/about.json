    "bio": "I am a flexible and fast-learning engineer with a strong backend foundation, always eager to adopt the latest technologies. I combine Python engineering with a habit of reading and implementing research papers in deep learning. I contribute to open‑source communities and enjoy bridging the gap between theory and production‑ready services. I am open to backend and ML‑oriented opportunities where I can tackle concrete, real‑world problems.",
